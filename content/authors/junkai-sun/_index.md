I am now a master student in Xidian University, supervised by [Prof. Yu Zheng](http://urban-computing.com/yuzheng) and [Junbo Zhang](https://zhangjunbo.org/). Prior to that, I completed my BSc in Computer Science at Xidian University. My research interests are focused on spatio-temporal data mining and deep learning in urban computing.
